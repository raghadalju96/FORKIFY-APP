![alt text](forkify.gif)

Forkify is a recipe search application that allows users to search for recipes, view details of each recipe, bookmark their favorite recipes,
adjust serving sizes, and even upload their own recipes to the database. The application fetches recipe data from an external API using the fetch API in JavaScript, and utilizes pagination to display search results efficiently.
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for better organization and separation of concerns. The project follows best practices for styling using Sass, with a modular approach that separates stylesheets into different components and utilities for better maintainability and scalability.
